'Losungen for Conky' is a small program that shows the daily watchwords in German from the Moravian church (Herrnhuter Bruedergemeine).  It is a Perl script. Its output is shown in Conky's window.
The program requires Linux, a Perl interpreter and the system monitor Conky.
No internet connection is required, except for the initial download of the program itself, the system monitoring program Conky and if necessary the Losungen texts.
The archive file already contains a current version of the Losungen texts. I successfully tested the program with Perl 5, Conky 1.7-1.10, GNOME 2 and 3, KDE Plasma 4 and 5, LXDE 4, OpenBox 3.5, XFCE 4 on Debian, Fedora, Mint, openSUSE and Ubuntu.
