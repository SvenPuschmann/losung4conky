*Losungen for Conky* shows the German daily watchwords from the Moravian church (Herrnhuter Bruedergemeine) in a Conky window.

# Requirements
The program requires Linux, a Perl interpreter and the system monitor Conky.
An internet connection is only required for installation and to update the watchwords.

I successfully tested the program with Perl 5, Conky 1.7-1.10 and various Linux distributions and desktop environments.
